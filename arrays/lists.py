#  EXERCISE 2 - LIST COPY
#
#  Lists are stored in variables by their reference and not their value.
#  This means when you do 'list2 = list1', you are not creating a new
#  list, but a new variable pointing to the same list1. If you edit
#  list2, you will also edit list1 as its the same list.
#  To avoid this, you need to make a copy of the list
#  The below 'list1' looks like:
list1 = [ "This", "is", "an", "list" ]
#  Save a copy of 'list1' into 'listCopy', and then append 'appendMe':
appendElement = "ok?"
#  to the end of 'listCopy'
#  'list1' should remain unchanged

#  EXERCISE 3 - LIST ROUND ROBIN

#  Remove the first element of the list 'cycleMe' and put it as the last
#  element of 'cycleMe'. Do this TWICE
#  e.g. [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] -> [ 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 ]
#  This is how round-robin functionality is implemented in apps that
#  involve "taking turns"
import random
cycleMe = list(range(1, random.randint(5, 15)))
#  ^Note how easy it is to create an list of random length in Py over JS
#  cycleMeCopy is just a copy of the 'cycleMe' list used for checking answers,
#  please ignore it

#  The following code tests the variables you need to work on to confirm your work is
#  correct. The if conditions check the variables are correct and the print()
#  statements are what make the print outs you see when you run the file. The below
#  is a crude demonstration of what we refer to as code tests. Code testing is a
#  common practice in the software engineer's role, where tests are run to confirm all
#  code runs correctly. Only when all tests pass would we give ourselves the green light
#  to ship code to production and feel confident the system will perform as expected.
