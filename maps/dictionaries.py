#  EXERCISE 1 - INITALIZATION
#
#  Initialize the 'newDict' variable with one key called "key"
#  that has a value which is a string called "value", it should look like:
#  {
#	"key": "value"
#  }
#
###################### YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE #######################

#  EXERCISE 2 - GET MY AGE
#
#  The 'getMyAge' dictionary contains my date of birth stored as year, month
#  and day.
import random
getMyAge = {
	"name": "John Nnamchi",
	"DOB": {
		"year": random.randint(1960, 2005),
		"month": random.randint(1, 12),
		"day": random.randint(1, 30),
	}
}
#  Your objective is to use the datetime data type to create a new date
#  with the year, month and day keys of the 'getMyAge' 'DOB' object and
#  determine how old this person is in days, months and years saved into
#  'ageInDays', 'ageInMonths' and 'ageInYears' respectively
#  Hint: The solution requires the inbuilt datetime module imported below
#  There is nothing complicated about this data type, in
#  fact this data type makes life much easier when working with date:
import datetime

#  EXERCISE 3 - DEEP COPY
#
#  The 'deepDictionary' dictionary contains my date of birth stored as the python
#  datetime data type. There is nothing complicated about this data type, in
#  fact this data type makes life much easier when working with date:

	"age": random.randint(15, 40),

		"Michael",
		"Alex",
		"Charles",
	]
}
#  Your objective is make a copy of 'deepDictionary' saved into 'deepDictionaryCopy'
#  and then do the following to 'deepDictionaryCopy':
#  - Change the name of 'deepDictionaryCopy' to "Kravis Lott"
#  - Leave the age unchanged
#  - Remove the last element from the "sibblings" list
#  Since 'deepDictionaryCopy' a copy it should leave 'deepDictionary' untouched
#  Hint: The solution requires the inbuilt copy module imported below
import copy

#  EXERCISE 4 - DICT MANIPULATION

	"name": "Christian Ronald",
	"grade": studentGrade,
	"gpa": studentGPA,
	"courses": [
		{
			"subject": "ENG",
			"level": 101,
		}
	]
}
#  Manipulate the student dictionary to reflect the following changes:
#  - They have moved up one grade
#  - Their GPA has dropped by 0.15 points
#  - They have taken a new course: MATH 204
#  - They got their first absence, add a new key called "absences" to
#	their record with a value of 1
#
#  Ignore the student copy dictionary below, it is used to check you work
studentCopy = dict(student)

#  DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SECTION UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE EXERCISES
#
#  The following code tests the variables you need to work on to confirm your work is
#  correct. The if conditions check the variables are correct and the print()
#  statements are what make the print outs you see when you run the file. The below
#  is a crude demonstration of what we refer to as code tests. Code testing is a
#  common practice in the software engineer's role, where tests are run to confirm all
#  code runs correctly. Only when all tests pass would we give ourselves the green light
#  to ship code to production and feel confident the system will perform as expected.
